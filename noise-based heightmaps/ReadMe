This is a GLSL shader that performs terrain generation and raymarching for rendering a scene with noise-based heightmaps and some Phong lighting. 


1.1 Fragment Shader (shaders/terrain.frag)

This is the GLSL code you provided. Save it as terrain.frag:

glsl

#ifdef GL_ES
precision mediump float;
#endif

// GLSL code you provided goes here

1.2 Vertex Shader (shaders/basic.vert)

We need a simple vertex shader for the scene:

glsl

#version 410 core

layout (location = 0) in vec3 aPos;

void main() {
    gl_Position = vec4(aPos, 1.0); // Pass position directly to fragment shader
}


Shaders: We are compiling the vertex and fragment shaders, and passing in data to the fragment shader using uniforms (iResolution and iTime).
Quad Rendering: A simple quad is rendered across the screen. The fragment shader takes care of generating the terrain, lighting, and fog effects.
Uniforms:

    iResolution: The resolution of the window (800x600 in this case).
    iTime: The elapsed time since the application started, passed as a uniform for animating the scene.
